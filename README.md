# Booksort

**An app for sorting small personal libraries**

I have too many books.

This makes it hard to organize them on my shelves, but also means I don't have a large enough collection to warrant the kind of software a real library would use.

Enter Booksort.

It's a basic app that (once finished) will let me keep my books sorted. This is the frontend, which will connect to the [Booksort backend](https://github.com/stephengroe/booksort-backend) via API. It will incorporate the same logic as my version-zero prototype, [tinylib](https://github.com/stephengroe/tinylib).

- **Live demo:** [https://stephengroe.github.io/booksort-frontend/](https://stephengroe.github.io/booksort-frontend/)
- **Built with:** React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **License:** MIT

## Features

Really quite few at this point. The layout is structured, but the logic is still a work in progress. I'll be importing that logiv from the previous iteration of this project, [tinylib](https://github.com/stephengroe/tinylib).

## Improvements

- [ ] **Add backend integration.** All data is currently just dummy data!
- [ ] **Make design responsive.** Currently only works on desktop/large tablet display sizes.
